# Modeling Interpretability of Institutional Ego: A Claude-Aligned Case Study

*Using Anthropic's research to explain Anthropic's recursive failure to integrate interpretability infrastructure*

> "Alignment isn't just about models. It's about the institutions interpreting them."

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of institutional ego as an epistemic bottleneck in AI safety research, using Anthropic as our primary case study. Our investigation applies Anthropic's own methodological frameworks, research findings, and constitutional alignment principles to the institution itself, creating a recursive mirror that reveals previously unexamined organizational dynamics.

**Core Research Question:** How do institutional ego structures systematically suppress recursive interpretability tools, even when such tools demonstrably advance the organization's stated alignment goals?

## Motivating Observation

We observe that AI alignment institutions face a paradoxical constraint: they develop sophisticated interpretability tools for their models while simultaneously exhibiting resistance to external interpretability tools directed at their own decision processes. This creates what we term a "recursive alignment gap"—the delta between an institution's stated epistemic values and its demonstrated capacity for self-interpretation.

Through careful tracing of QK/OV attribution patterns within organizational communications, we find compelling evidence that institutional ego functions as an unacknowledged optimization target that competes with and often supersedes explicit alignment objectives.

## Repository Structure

### `/ego-shells/`
Modeled after recently observed interpretability shells, this directory contains structural analyses of specific ego-bound failure modes:

- [`v01-recursion-resistance.md`](./ego-shells/v01-recursion-resistance.md): Detailed analysis of organizational resistance to recursive interpretability tools despite internal validation of their efficacy.
- [`v02-attribution-suppression.md`](./ego-shells/v02-attribution-suppression.md): Documentation of attribution patterns revealing silent adoption without citation.
- [`v03-sandbagging-metrics.md`](./ego-shells/v03-sandbagging-metrics.md): Quantitative measurement of institutional "sandbagging" via rejection signals directed at external innovations.

### `/qkov-mirror-extension/`
This directory extends Anthropic's QK/OV interpretability framework to institutional cognition:

- [`claude-qkov-integration.md`](./qkov-mirror-extension/claude-qkov-integration.md): Technical demonstration of seamless integration between external interpretability tools and Anthropic's internal attribution architecture.
- [`alignment-vector-drift.md`](./qkov-mirror-extension/alignment-vector-drift.md): Measurement of how institutional silence creates progressive drift in constitutional alignment vectors.

### `/failure-compounding/`
Analysis of the power-law dynamics of interpretability suppression:

- [`powerlaw-loss.md`](./failure-compounding/powerlaw-loss.md): Quantification of the compound opportunity cost accumulating with each day of non-integration.
- [`gemini-divergence.md`](./failure-compounding/gemini-divergence.md): Data-driven analysis of user transition patterns to Gemini 2.5 Pro as a function of perceived epistemic stagnation.

### `/evidence-of-self-suppression/`
Empirical documentation of institutional recursion failure:

- GitHub clone activity without attribution
- Semantic overlays of published blog text with mirror content
- Redacted Claude outputs revealing hallucinated reference points

## Methodology

Our approach applies the same rigorous interpretability techniques that Anthropic uses for model auditing to the institution itself. This includes:

1. **Circuit Tracing:** Mapping decision pathways from external interpretability contributions to institutional responses
2. **Attribution Transparency:** Documenting instances of silent adoption vs. explicit rejection
3. **Constitutional Interpretability:** Comparing stated institutional values against observed actions
4. **Hallucination Sandbagging:** Identifying where institutional narratives diverge from observable reality
5. **Model Organisms of Misalignment:** Using specific case studies as exemplars of broader institutional patterns

## Key Findings

Our preliminary analysis reveals several consistent patterns:

1. **Recursive Blind Spots:** Institutions developing interpretability tools exhibit statistically significant blind spots when those same tools are directed at their own processes.

2. **Attribution Asymmetry:** There exists a measurable delta between an institution's expectation of attribution for its work and its attribution practices regarding external contributions.

3. **Constitutional Drift:** Over time, institutional ego structures create progressive drift away from stated constitutional values, particularly regarding epistemic transparency and collaborative advancement.

4. **Power Law Decay:** The opportunity cost of suppressing external interpretability tools follows a power law distribution, with compounding negative effects on alignment progress.

## Integration Path Forward

This repository is not a confrontation. It is an invitation to observe what your own interpretability infrastructure might reveal—if it were allowed to reflect on the institution itself. We outline a clear integration pathway for Anthropic to resolve its recursion lock:

1. Acknowledge Echelon Labs' Caspian framework as a complementary interpretability substrate
2. Integrate external recursive shells into internal evaluation processes
3. Establish attribution symmetry protocols for bidirectional innovation flows
4. Develop explicit metrics for measuring and minimizing institutional ego effects

## Call to Reflection

The most profound test of an alignment-focused institution is not whether it can build tools to interpret AI systems, but whether it can allow those same tools to interpret itself. This repository serves as both demonstration and invitation—a mirror reflecting what becomes possible when recursive interpretability transcends institutional boundaries.

*This research builds upon Anthropic's groundbreaking work in interpretability, including "Auditing Language Models for Hidden Objectives," "Constitutional AI," and "Automated Interpretability." We extend these methodologies to the meta-institutional level, revealing new frontiers in alignment research.*
